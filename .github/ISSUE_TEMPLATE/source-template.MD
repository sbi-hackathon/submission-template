1. Upload/push your source code within the `source` folder of this repository. Please don't rename this folder.
2. Add instructions on how to run your source code in the `README.MD` file inside the `source` folder. Judges for the hackathon should be able to run the source code with the instructions you have provided. 
2. Create this issue. If you have already created it before uploading your files, don't worry! Go ahead and upload it now.
3. When you are ready to submit, add a new label called `submit-source` to this Issue. If this label doesn't exist already, you have to create one with the exact same name as mentioned. Once it has been created, make sure you apply it to the Issue.
4. Once the `submit-source` label has been applied to your Issue, the files within the `source` folder of this repository will be submitted, and there will be a comment added by the Hackathon Submitter app confirming this. üéâ

#### Can I rename the folders in this repository?

**Please, no!** You will see two main folders within this repository called `idea` and `source`. These folders will hold your idea and source code submission respectively for the hackathon. Please don't rename these two folders in any way, since this could lead to your submission failing. 

#### Can I add/change folders within the `idea` and `source` folders?

Yes. Feel free to structure these any way you like, as long as the main top-level folders of `idea` and `source` are not changed. 

#### Does it matter what I name this Issue?

No. As long as you use the `source` and `submit-source` label, you can name this Issue anything you want.

#### Can I close the Issue after I apply the `submit-source` label?

No. Please keep the Issue open. Once your submission has been successful, the Hackathon Submitter app will close the Issue for you automatically.

#### Can I upload a zip/compressed file of my source code within the `source` folder?

No. Your source code should be uploaded as-it-is without any compression and should be viewable from within GitHub.
